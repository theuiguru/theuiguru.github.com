Seriously, I felt like dancing to all the hymns today at church (I was that excited). You don't know how I look forward to this day every year, besides Christmas of course. It's true what the infamous Tenny Thomas achen was saying about Easter being the \"festival of festivals\" and how we put on our BEST clothes, and yes I LITERALLY spent the day before, shopping for new clothing items and accessories. It's practically my second Christmas. \n\nBut all in all, this lent has taught me a lot. I feel like every year it's the same for me in terms of having similar problems faced during lent. If you know me, some people describe me as the Incredible Hulk. I can struggle with anger, a lot. Especially with having temp jobs to looking for a full-time one, or even just applying to grad school programs in computer science. I am often angry because I want people to be satisfied with their needs first ahead than my own. When I went to my first confession back in 2011 at Baltimore Leadership Camp, Leeson achen made me realize that I strive for perfection a lot (as a typical Indian-malayalee would). I mean I know there's a whole bunch out there since the Internet is a HUGE place to go to for tutorials and such on anger management. But in my mind, being the Internet the way it is with advertising, I think that there's no way to really control it. I guess since then, or at least since college started, I have been often quiet a lot mainly because I will always try to hold it in from saying something lame. Then again, this lent has made me make confident decisions in wanting something urgently (of course not love yet). \n\nHappy Easter to all, and to all a good night.",

A couple of cousins from Philly came on Saturday to spend lunch with us, while they were still here in New York. After that, was getting ready to head out to a future leadership camp committee interest meeting at 'cherry lane' church. On the way there, I was pretty darn excited, I got the radio pumped to a high enough volume, got a parking spot (not that it matters) and met some old and new friends. But then again, I get excited because I definitely want to be a part of this once-in-a-lifetime experience assisting with the technology aspect of things for the year to come. We've had the pleasure of having a former NYLC convener and a former committee member speak about their experience(s). After hearing, I didn't know if I wanted to sign-up or not. A while later, it was time to nominate people for convener(s) and lead(s) for the respective sub-committees. I mean I hear all sorts of names of those who were\/are active and those who weren't. Out of nowhere, I hear a young gentleman say 'Chris', pointing at me apparently (I initially thought there was someone named Chris behind me, knowingly there wasn't). And another young gentleman seconded that. I could've sworn I had no intention on becoming convener nor lead, I just wanted to be a part of this just for the technology support. After hearing my name, I was thinking of what Moses said to God of who am I to lead these people? Like really? ME?! I wanted to decline at first because most people who were nominated did as well, but then again, I was talking to the person right next to me (who happens to go to my parish) and she said \"let's see how it goes.\" So, I didn't resist raising my hand wanting to decline. After that, there were three remaining candidates, and each were given a short message on why they are good for the job of being convener (just to be clear: the result is not official until the diocesan metropolitan bishop says so). . As my turn came up, I said I involved myself in many activities within the national and area levels (i.e. website, leadership camps, missions trip, etc.). I mean I forgot some things out, but as they were tallying the results and said the other two won, I kind of felt a little overwhelmed because I thought I'd let those two people down for mentioning my name. While on the way back home, I was thinking over and over throughout the weekend, I was thinking what am I good for then? I mean do people care so much about a camp website, the logistics, and other important types of information?. I guess what I'm trying to say is that sure I felt a little sad, but then again satisfied at the same time for making some sort of influence unto others. I guess that's what truly matters in life, the little and ordinary things. \n\nAs Thirumeni (bishop) and the diocesan team looks over all of the applications, please pray for them as they make a suitable decision in making a fantastic team to be a part of this truly life-changing experience. \n\nUPDATE: Well, by the Grace of God, I've made the New York Leadership Camp committee.

First, I woke up to the sound of my alarm at 6AM to snooze it and go back to sleep, until I hear the sound of my mom's voice waking me up at around 6:40AM (The Big Bang Theory's Howard Wolowitz's mom's voice). I then get ready and start heading out to pick up a girl from my church, (wait for it...she's younger) to then go on our way to another parish member's house for us to get a lift from him all the way to St. Mary's Jackson Heights church. On our way there, we made a pit stop at a local dunkin donuts and got breakfast, and then headed out to the church. When we arrive, we start chit-chatting with other fellow parish reps. Next, we went inside the sanctuary for morning prayers and a parish rep meeting about different matters and such (Oh by the way, did you know New York will be hosting another leadership camp in 2015?!...shhh, don't tell anyone yet!). We start heading into the basement of the church to start preparing lunch bags for \"people who are homeless\" as a #Feed500 support (I added #Feed50 as the title because we only prepared fifty) with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a snack and a water in them. \n\nWe all finally start heading out to walk to the subway train station (7 train) all the way down to Times Square. When we arrive, I finally looked up and saw the 2014 lighted sign up on top (as seen on tv on new years day), and of course we bump into Mario along the way (he\/she sounded just like him). Next, we all separated into designated groups and walk a lot farther to 46th street. My group, however, came across some interesting homeless people. Some of my group mates said I got a tad bit more excited than I usually am about spotting homeless people on the streets. Until we came across a guy named Dirk (later he said Derrick, identity theft crisis perhaps?) and started bashing up on politics and how this world is so messed up (of course he used words I will not use publicly on the web), but it got me wondering that he's like anyone else, being frustrated at the miseries of government, economy and such. Later he said he got accused at a local library for being a bad guy for something I wasn't too sure of. But he's certainly right, government is screwing us over. He said he was from the Russian Orthodox faith and an immigrant too. I was a bit surprised at the fact that he also quoted St. John Chrysostom. After we talked, I spent for a coffee to give to him because he wanted one so bad (he said he'll pay me back, one day). But then again, it suddenly hit me, as Bobby Varghese (area councilman) pointed out, these people are just like us, their behaviors, actions and deeds. The only thing is that they look funny. I remember talking to him within the group and a couple walked by and smirked (S.M.H. = Shakin' My Head.) After that, we got food off of the biryani cart, for the first time, that Bobby always craves for, which wasn't so bad. Finally, we headed back to the church and we were on our way home.

However, been wondering why the heck people, especially the young-ins, do support Barack Obama for President. I mean honestly, Why?!? Because he caught someone that we were tracking for since September 11th, or even reasons being that he's African-American. Let's not forget the fact that he publicly stated his support for the gay rights community. It just sickens me that politics is as usual, and people vote for him primarily because he's black, seriously?!? \n\nI was watching the season two premiere of the ABC sitcom: Last Man Standing (the show with Tim Allen), last week, and it talked about the political-economical facts that this nation is currently facing. I've actually\u00a0\u00a0this out in which Tim Allen responds within the show: \"Obama is looking out for working people. He's gotta look out for them 'cause they're nowhere to be found.\" which is amusing, yet very true. Plus, citing the fact that Obama caught Osama Bin Laden, in which he didn't but some navy seals did. If someone says that fact one more time, I swear I'm gonna pull the \"But what about Bush?\" comment, because to be fair, under Bush's leadership, we caught Saddam Hussein and built a homeland security system (Yes-sirree, he did do something effective throughout the nation in which he got re-elected for a second term!) \n\nYou see (for those of you who are actually reading this), I'm for neither candidate, even back in high school, I was always in the middle of the political spectrum leading a little towards conservative beliefs. To be quite frank, I don't give a damn about politics, because it's all a popularity contest of who's better looking (that's why JFK got elected). In the end, your vote won't count, you know why? Because it is all up to the electoral college (primarily made up of Congressmen) who vote for the President (At least that's what I've learned in high school and college political science classes). And that's another thing, READ your Constitutional given rights, people! There is nowhere in it that says the President makes the laws, or has much power in that matter (besides vetoing power). But furthermore, all it really says is it's just a title he holds to represent the country.

Then, went inside the limo on the way to church and to the reception hall. But on the way to the reception, we made a pit stop for another photo shoot at a beautiful place, which happened to be private property, but then again managed to get through it. Both the wedding and reception were really wonderful and well-organized, especially the band that played all night. After the reception, which ended at like elevenish, went inside a bar until one (didn't know how I got in) and conversed with some really cool people of Ranjit and Erica. I later went back to my hotel room (shared with Justin and Alex) and slept at three or so, and woke up at about eight in the morning. That Sunday morning, went off to have brunch and started to check out of the hotel. \n\nAfter the marvelous wedding, my sister and I went with the Colorado family on the way home. Then made a pit-stop on the bridge (don't remember which one though) to help out an accident that just occurred in front of us. So, went home, got some rest, and went off to Syosset for Jabin's birthday party, which also turned out great as well as some people, including myself, were really tired from the wedding weekend. So overall, I have had an amazing and fun-filled weekend to remember with family and friends.

Anyway, I've actually been getting used to my new school, hanging out with friends, browsing through some random videos and reading some new blog and twitter-feeds, plus learning some new programming languages on the side via youtube. On another note, getting into lenten season mode nowadays while reading all the Scripture readings, online devotionals, and special prayers. \n\nThis past weekend, went to Philly with family and aunt from India to go visit some family there. For my first time in Philly, went to go see a movie with the cousins at the United Artist Theatres near their apartment, \"Alice in Wonderland\" starring Johnny Depp, which was an ok movie to watch. After the movie, went to Dunkin' Donuts, and spent the night. Then on Sunday, went to St. Gregorios, Philadelphia church to receive the Holy Qurbana for the fourth week in a row during GL (aka Great Lent). After that, went back to the apartments and spent some time there with the cousins until one cousin, Nathan, came around and things got really fun. So overall, the weekend was a blast there in Philly, wish I could go there like every month now.",

Then, it got dark, and all of our phones were out of range, when we finally reached there at the Eagle Landing cabins. Throughout the weekends, actually took the time to get to have fellowship and fun with everyone. We all did activities like playing games (e.g. Scattergories), canoeing, hiking, and zip-lining (although I didn't go). On Saturday night, our family had this talent show for some people perform, which was pretty hillarious especially the ones introducing the Molethu Family Enterprises. Then, on Sunday, packed up and was ready to hit the roads. Actually showed up at Philly around six and went home back to New York and reached at like eleven. I felt pretty tired from the long drives in and out of Virginia, but a blessed time with my huge Molethu family. \n\nOh yeah also I think I actually won this week for my fantasy football league, even though I didn't pay attention.",

On Friday, did the usual on the listed routine, got the official camp t-shirts, and had a retreat-mode evening to night in preparation for Holy Qurbana. On Saturday, celebrated the Holy Qurbana at 9:00 AM, and cleaned everything up after people checked out. After the camp, made a pit-stop at Anita's house and then went straight to Jobin's apartment, talked, watched a movie for a bit, and slept early because I was tired. \n\nToday, went to service at St. Gregorios, Philadelphia and was a newcomer there as well. It was my first time seeing the church after the consecration, in which the church looked beautiful.

        "markdown": "This past Thursday (July 24th), I recently went to the MGOCSM Leadership Camp of 2008, which was hosted by the New York area, held in Ramapo College. The theme was _Uncovering Our Roots: Bringing Orthodoxy Back_. At first, it started off with me saying goodbye to my folks and headed off to LaGuardia Airport; Central Terminal at Baggage Claim. There, I was greeted by the NYLC Transportation Committee, and some new people still waiting for the bus. While still waiting, they played a few icebreaker games to keep us entertained. Anyway, I went on the van, to Ramapo, and on the way I met three people from Houston, one from Detroit, and the rest from my area. So, total in the van were eight (including myself), along with the driver, which happened to be Saju Chacko (aka MC Vikram). When we arrived there at Ramapo, I started to register at the NYLC front table and getting settled in my dorm room. After that, we started going off to dinner and evening prayers, and then there was the lighting of the lamp along with a few messages by Barnabas and Nicholovos Thiruminis, Mat semessan (General Secretary), and the co-conveners, Jomy Chandy and Anu Jacob. After all that, they showed some presentations (including the new AM-Team video), which is also shown on . We then were separated into our small groups, I was part of the A-Train. The first thing we had to do was an icebreaker, in which we had to do a small skit, without talking, and people had to guess what it was (my group was about the Paralytic). After the icebreaker, we had some refreshments and then went off to our area meetings to discuss about leadership. After the meeting, we had game night in the dorm lobby, in which everyone was playing either cards, pictionary, or even taboo. At the end of the night, we concluded by saying the compline prayers and heading off to bed. My roommates and I started staying up so late and talking about simple stuff. \n\nOn Friday, I kind of woke up late, than the usual schedule. In the morning, we had a special wake-up call by the committee, banging drums and our doors to wake us up for prayers, devotional address by Gheevarghese chem, devotional songs, and our first main speaker, Fr. Josiah, who was funny in most of his speeches. Then, there were workshops discussing about the Church, noon prayer, lunch, and a small group activity, which was a scavenger hunt (my group came in second to last). Then, we had another main speaker, Mother Magdalena, refreshments, another small group discussion, panel discussion, and then dinner. After all that, we had evening prayer and devotional address by Daniel chem. Then, we got ready for a team building activity in the gym, including Blob tag. We all then went outside for a special ice cream treat, playing basketball and volleyball, talking, and music playing. This event was so memorable. It ended with compline prayers and we just sitting and talking to each other, including Daniel chem making fun of Tenny Thomas. \n\nOn Saturday, it started off with the usual, this time I woke up nice and early. Some of us were tired during the lectures and workshops, but I tried keeping myself awake. All the small groups did something really cool, which was writing our own kukliyons. My group, however, did it small because we didn't have enough time to finish it. Anyway, we then had lunch, songs, and a presentation by the missions trip team of 2008\\. We then went off to our area meetings to discuss about witnessing and the mission within our areas. After that, we had an MGOCSM General Assembly meeting discussing about the annual secretary and financial reports, along with electing a new Genral Secretary and Treasurer. After that, the 2009 Atlanta Leadership Camp committee shown us a promo presentation (also shown on YouTube). After that presentation, all the small groups presented our own kukliyons (my group had Jimmy Panicker from Chicago doing the censor), then the conveners presented the souvenirs, and then went off to dinner. After dinner, we had evening prayer, a retreat message, and meditational times before Sunday. \n\nOn Sunday, we woke up at 5:30 AM, and then got ready for morning prayers and Holy Qurbana. After the service, we had our entire Leadership Camp group photo being taken, along with closing remarks by the conveners, a slide show, a reflection session by each area representative, and the lighting of the lamp for the 2009 leadership camp in Atlanta.

        "html": "This past Thursday (July 24th), I recently went to the MGOCSM Leadership Camp of 2008, which was hosted by the New York area, held in Ramapo College. The theme was <em>Uncovering Our Roots: Bringing Orthodoxy Back<\/em>. At first, it started off with me saying goodbye to my folks and headed off to LaGuardia Airport; Central Terminal at Baggage Claim. There, I was greeted by the NYLC Transportation Committee, and some new people still waiting for the bus. While still waiting, they played a few icebreaker games to keep us entertained. Anyway, I went on the van, to Ramapo, and on the way I met three people from Houston, one from Detroit, and the rest from my area. So, total in the van were eight (including myself), along with the driver, which happened to be Saju Chacko (aka MC Vikram). When we arrived there at Ramapo, I started to register at the NYLC front table and getting settled in my dorm room. After that, we started going off to dinner and evening prayers, and then there was the lighting of the lamp along with a few messages by Barnabas and Nicholovos Thiruminis, Mat semessan (General Secretary), and the co-conveners, Jomy Chandy and Anu Jacob. After all that, they showed some presentations (including the new AM-Team video), which is also shown on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nylc08.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.nylc08.com<\/a>. We then were separated into our small groups, I was part of the A-Train. The first thing we had to do was an icebreaker, in which we had to do a small skit, without talking, and people had to guess what it was (my group was about the Paralytic). After the icebreaker, we had some refreshments and then went off to our area meetings to discuss about leadership. After the meeting, we had game night in the dorm lobby, in which everyone was playing either cards, pictionary, or even taboo. At the end of the night, we concluded by saying the compline prayers and heading off to bed. My roommates and I started staying up so late and talking about simple stuff.<br \/><br \/>On Friday, I kind of woke up late, than the usual schedule. In the morning, we had a special wake-up call by the committee, banging drums and our doors to wake us up for prayers, devotional address by Gheevarghese chem, devotional songs, and our first main speaker, Fr. Josiah, who was funny in most of his speeches. Then, there were workshops discussing about the Church, noon prayer, lunch, and a small group activity, which was a scavenger hunt (my group came in second to last). Then, we had another main speaker, Mother Magdalena, refreshments, another small group discussion, panel discussion, and then dinner. After all that, we had evening prayer and devotional address by Daniel chem. Then, we got ready for a team building activity in the gym, including Blob tag. We all then went outside for a special ice cream treat, playing basketball and volleyball, talking, and music playing. This event was so memorable. It ended with compline prayers and we just sitting and talking to each other, including Daniel chem making fun of Tenny Thomas.<br \/><br \/>On Saturday, it started off with the usual, this time I woke up nice and early. Some of us were tired during the lectures and workshops, but I tried keeping myself awake. All the small groups did something really cool, which was writing our own kukliyons. My group, however, did it small because we didn't have enough time to finish it. Anyway, we then had lunch, songs, and a presentation by the missions trip team of 2008. We then went off to our area meetings to discuss about witnessing and the mission within our areas. After that, we had an MGOCSM General Assembly meeting discussing about the annual secretary and financial reports, along with electing a new Genral Secretary and Treasurer. After that, the 2009 Atlanta Leadership Camp committee shown us a promo presentation (also shown on YouTube). After that presentation, all the small groups presented our own kukliyons (my group had Jimmy Panicker from Chicago doing the censor), then the conveners presented the souvenirs, and then went off to dinner. After dinner, we had evening prayer, a retreat message, and meditational times before Sunday.<br \/><br \/>On Sunday, we woke up at 5:30 AM, and then got ready for morning prayers and Holy Qurbana. After the service, we had our entire Leadership Camp group photo being taken, along with closing remarks by the conveners, a slide show, a reflection session by each area representative, and the lighting of the lamp for the 2009 leadership camp in Atlanta. After all that, we had lunch, packed our things, checked out, and said our goodbyes to each other. Overall, it was truly an amazing and blessed experience of my life, and I still miss everyone I met there.

Anyway, when we got there, we first grabbed lunch, and I ate a chicken tenders meal, with fries and a Mountain Dew. After that, we went on our hiking trail and it was absolutely beautiful seeing nature and the falls flowing. It kind of made me reminisce about the time when I went on that trip to St. Tikhon's Seminary. So, anyway, most of us were a little tired about going up and down the stairs, of the mountain. After the hike, we then relaxed a bit, and then rode off home, back to New York. Also, we stopped at an outlet store on the way, Odd-A-Lot, in which one of my cousins bought fireworks to use for himself. So, we decided to grab some dinner at this Thai restaurant called _Jaiya_. Overall, it was a fun adventure and a great experience for me.",
