Today is the 20th of august 2011. We just returned from Swithin's wedding or whatever. He has just lost his bachelor's degree and Rena has gained her masters. Photos will be there in the library. This is not Chris typing btw.... This is chris' evil twin kris. I'm the cooler one anyway. I am holding Chris for ransom but I don't think anyone will give him any pity so I don't expect any money for his ransom. If it happens i'd probably just let the dogs on him. I think I just heard Chris making some noise so I should probably give him some food. Goodbye for now. Chris will probably be the one to write next. Although perhaps not because has been bound and gagged. Xoxo kris.
