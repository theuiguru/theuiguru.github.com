Had all types of emotion run through me today during and after church, wondering what to eat today rather than focus on the mental aspects of it. Seriously, I felt like dancing to all the hymns today at church (I was that excited). You don't know how I look forward to this day every year, besides Christmas of course. It's true what the infamous Tenny Thomas achen was saying about Easter being the "festival of festivals" and how we put on our BEST clothes, and yes I LITERALLY spent the day before, shopping for new clothing items and accessories. It's practically my second Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, this lent has taught me a lot. I feel like every year it's the same for me in terms of having similar problems faced during lent. If you know me, some people describe me as the Incredible Hulk. I can struggle with anger, a lot. Especially with having temp jobs to looking for a full-time one, or even just applying to grad school programs in computer science. I am often angry because I want people to be satisfied with their needs first ahead than my own. When I went to my first confession back in 2011 at Baltimore Leadership Camp, Leeson achen made me realize that I strive for perfection a lot (as a typical Indian-malayalee would). I mean I know there's a whole bunch out there since the Internet is a HUGE place to go to for tutorials and such on anger management. But in my mind, being the Internet the way it is with advertising, I think that there's no way to really control it. I guess since then, or at least since college started, I have been often quiet a lot mainly because I will always try to hold it in from saying something lame. Then again, this lent has made me make confident decisions in wanting something urgently (of course not love yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Easter to all, and to all a good night.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8076105625621201821'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8076105625621201821'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2014/04/greatlent2014.html' title='#GreatLent2014'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7717960943937358611</id><published>2014-03-17T17:54:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2014-12-03T12:04:02.632-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Who am I really?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;So, I forgot to post this yesterday but here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually didn't have a bad weekend at all. A couple of cousins from Philly came on Saturday to spend lunch with us, while they were still here in New York. After that, was getting ready to head out to a future leadership camp committee interest meeting at 'cherry lane' church. On the way there, I was pretty darn excited, I got the radio pumped to a high enough volume, got a parking spot (not that it matters) and met some old and new friends. But then again, I get excited because I definitely want to be a part of this once-in-a-lifetime experience assisting with the technology aspect of things for the year to come. We've had the pleasure of having a former NYLC convener and a former committee member speak about their experience(s). After hearing, I didn't know if I wanted to sign-up or not. A while later, it was time to nominate people for convener(s) and lead(s) for the respective sub-committees. I mean I hear all sorts of names of those who were/are active and those who weren't. Out of nowhere, I hear a young gentleman say 'Chris', pointing at me apparently (I initially thought there was someone named Chris behind me, knowingly there wasn't). And another young gentleman seconded that. I could've sworn I had no intention on becoming convener nor lead, I just wanted to be a part of this just for the technology support. After hearing my name, I was thinking of what Moses said to God of who am I to lead these people? Like really? ME?! I wanted to decline at first because most people who were nominated did as well, but then again, I was talking to the person right next to me (who happens to go to my parish) and she said "let's see how it goes." So, I didn't resist raising my hand wanting to decline. After that, there were three remaining candidates, and each were given a short message on why they are good for the job of being convener (just to be clear: the result is not official until the diocesan metropolitan bishop says so). &lt;a href="http://sabhaadvocate.blogspot.com/2007/12/diocesan-assembly-electsme.html" target="_blank"&gt;I felt like Sunil Kurian (friend's brother) as he was nominated for Diocesan Council, which is another story too long to tell&lt;/a&gt;. As my turn came up, I said I involved myself in many activities within the national and area levels (i.e. website, leadership camps, missions trip, etc.). I mean I forgot some things out, but as they were tallying the results and said the other two won, I kind of felt a little overwhelmed because I thought I'd let those two people down for mentioning my name. While on the way back home, I was thinking over and over throughout the weekend, I was thinking what am I good for then? I mean do people care so much about a camp website, the logistics, and other important types of information?. I guess what I'm trying to say is that sure I felt a little sad, but then again satisfied at the same time for making some sort of influence unto others. I guess that's what truly matters in life, the little and ordinary things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Thirumeni (bishop) and the diocesan team looks over all of the applications, please pray for them as they make a suitable decision in making a fantastic team to be a part of this truly life-changing experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Well, by the Grace of God, I've made the New York Leadership Camp committee. Sadly, I'm not convener nor lead, but I have the greatest title of all: &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/p/LJ0N2TFi6B" target="_blank"&gt;WEBMASTER&lt;/a&gt;.

First, I woke up to the sound of my alarm at 6AM to snooze it and go back to sleep, until I hear the sound of my mom's voice waking me up at around 6:40AM (The Big Bang Theory's Howard Wolowitz's mom's voice). I then get ready and start heading out to pick up a girl from my church, (wait for it...she's younger) to then go on our way to another parish member's house for us to get a lift from him all the way to St. Mary's Jackson Heights church. On our way there, we made a pit stop at a local dunkin donuts and got breakfast, and then headed out to the church. When we arrive, we start chit-chatting with other fellow parish reps. Next, we went inside the sanctuary for morning prayers and a parish rep meeting about different matters and such (Oh by the way, did you know New York will be hosting another leadership camp in 2015?!...shhh, don't tell anyone yet!). We start heading into the basement of the church to start preparing lunch bags for "people who are homeless" as a #Feed500 support (I added #Feed50 as the title because we only prepared fifty) with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, a snack and a water in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all finally start heading out to walk to the subway train station (7 train) all the way down to Times Square. When we arrive, I finally looked up and saw the 2014 lighted sign up on top (as seen on tv on new years day), and of course we bump into Mario along the way (he/she sounded just like him). Next, we all separated into designated groups and walk a lot farther to 46th street. My group, however, came across some interesting homeless people. Some of my group mates said I got a tad bit more excited than I usually am about spotting homeless people on the streets. Until we came across a guy named Dirk (later he said Derrick, identity theft crisis perhaps?) and started bashing up on politics and how this world is so messed up (of course he used words I will not use publicly on the web), but it got me wondering that he's like anyone else, being frustrated at the miseries of government, economy and such. Later he said he got accused at a local library for being a bad guy for something I wasn't too sure of. But he's certainly right, government is screwing us over. He said he was from the Russian Orthodox faith and an immigrant too. I was a bit surprised at the fact that he also quoted St. John Chrysostom. After we talked, I spent for a coffee to give to him because he wanted one so bad (he said he'll pay me back, one day). But then again, it suddenly hit me, as Bobby Varghese (area councilman) pointed out, these people are just like us, their behaviors, actions and deeds. The only thing is that they look funny. I remember talking to him within the group and a couple walked by and smirked (S.M.H. = Shakin' My Head.) After that, we got food off of the biryani cart, for the first time, that Bobby always craves for, which wasn't so bad. Finally, we headed back to the church and we were on our way home. Here are some pictures from today, by the way:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KHr2HWM8dEk/Uttbb0cKw8I/AAAAAAAACkw/UsZRNjjQBI0/s1600/IMAG0555.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KHr2HWM8dEk/Uttbb0cKw8I/AAAAAAAACkw/UsZRNjjQBI0/s1600/IMAG0555.jpg" height="400" width="225" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1524603_10153733794045541_1897453530_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="322" src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/1524603_10153733794045541_1897453530_n.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6660051883884870922'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6660051883884870922'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2014/01/feed50.html' title='#Feed50!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KHr2HWM8dEk/Uttbb0cKw8I/AAAAAAAACkw/UsZRNjjQBI0/s72-c/IMAG0555.jpg' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7702343854008616014</id><published>2014-01-05T19:22:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2014-01-05T21:01:56.340-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Blog Redesign</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Apparently, I have been delving more into front-end development and user experience design. Based on my previous contracting jobs, I have been playing around with the Internet more and more, especially with browser developer tools (i.e. Chrome and Firefox), and git. I was having trouble where to host my personal space on the web whether it be on Blogger, Github, Harp, etc. And I was trying a lot of different methods in which to make me a better developer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;Like recently, I have been playing around with the Twitter Bootstrap 3 framework integration with Blogger based off of a bookmarked &lt;a href="http://tudor-anghelina.blogspot.com/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; I saved in my &lt;a href="http://del.icio.us/cthomas1211"&gt;del.icio.us&lt;/a&gt; account. I've searched and searched all throughout Google (for many days) for this solution. Over the past few months, I've realized that blogging is getting more common now more than ever whether it be through Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Medium, you get the deal, in which people can freely post content. Another alternative I turned to was messing around with the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/harpplatform"&gt;@HarpPlatform&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and making boilerplate templates. Even last year, I installed nodejs and wrote my first "Hello World" program. What I definitely like the most is that majority of sites (or all) turn out to be static in the end until the user(s) uses the web application. It's like what the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/harpplatform"&gt;@HarpPlatform&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;says on their features page, "Static is the new dynamic". Furthermore, this whole site is using blogger code with twitter bootstrap framework embedded, plus used the same color scheme as the &lt;a href="https://www.harp.io/features"&gt;Harp platform's features page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: justify;"&gt;I have been meaning to get back into my blogging grind.

Been meaning to know which direction to take, but knowing me there's no direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, in regard to this whole election day, been thinking about who to vote for, especially in times like the economic crisis, healthcare issues, and all of that political "mumbo-jumbo". However, been wondering why the heck people, especially the young-ins, do support Barack Obama for President. I mean honestly, Why?!? Because he caught someone that we were tracking for since September 11th, or even reasons being that he's African-American. Let's not forget the fact that he publicly stated his support for the gay rights community. It just sickens me that politics is as usual, and people vote for him primarily because he's black, seriously?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was watching the season two premiere of the ABC sitcom: Last Man Standing (the show with Tim Allen), last week, and it talked about the political-economical facts that this nation is currently facing. I've actually&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cthomas1211/status/264745369580236800"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;this out in which Tim Allen responds within the show: "Obama is looking out for working people. He's gotta look out for them 'cause they're nowhere to be found." which is amusing, yet very true. Plus, citing the fact that Obama caught Osama Bin Laden, in which he didn't but some navy seals did. If someone says that fact one more time, I swear I'm gonna pull the "But what about Bush?" comment, because to be fair, under Bush's leadership, we caught Saddam Hussein and built a homeland security system (Yes-sirree, he did do something effective throughout the nation in which he got re-elected for a second term!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see (for those of you who are actually reading this), I'm for neither candidate, even back in high school, I was always in the middle of the political spectrum leading a little towards conservative beliefs. To be quite frank, I don't give a damn about politics, because it's all a popularity contest of who's better looking (that's why JFK got elected). In the end, your vote won't count, you know why? Because it is all up to the electoral college (primarily made up of Congressmen) who vote for the President (At least that's what I've learned in high school and college political science classes). And that's another thing, READ your Constitutional given rights, people! There is nowhere in it that says the President makes the laws, or has much power in that matter (besides vetoing power). But furthermore, all it really says is it's just a title he holds to represent the country. If you really want to blame someone on war, peace, or whatever-the-heck, try finding out who your local congressman is and reach out to him/her to get your voice across government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I'm saying is try to&amp;nbsp;think TWICE before you get into that voting booth, and choose the best candidate that will fulfill your promised need(s).&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/9119451174377098224'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/9119451174377098224'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2012/11/thoughts-on-election-day_6.html' title='Thoughts on Election Day'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7151974154642050010</id><published>2012-02-12T17:15:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2012-02-12T17:17:17.357-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>2012 New Year's Resolutions</title><content type='html'>1.

In addition, I've set up and managed my fantasy football team in my 'cuzinz' league entitled "The IT guy", for week 1, and already not as much points as I've deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I've been quite an active user of digg.com nowadays and I've dugg up a video relating to what I've seen on an episode of The Office where it's based upon Pavlov's (psychologist) principle on &lt;a href="http://www.break.com/index/classical-conditioning-on-college-roommate" target="_blank"&gt;classical conditioning&lt;/a&gt;. And another hillarious thing I've seen just recently today was on Mindy Kaling's twitter page where it says "&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mindykaling/status/24100767386" target="_blank"&gt;Supervising gory blood spatters on set. It's not Dexter, it's not True Blood, it's The Office.&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, that's all for this week and hopefully this week gets better for me.

I have some interesting classes with decent professors, such as Constitutional Law and Politics, Technical Communications, Discrete Math, and Data Structures and Algorithms. So, the first week turned out great, and considering that all my classes are in the evening now, from Monday through Thursday, and one on Saturdays as well. Anyway yesterday, went to dinner with my family cousins at this new place called "Famous Daves" in celebration of my sister's eighteenth birthday. And of course, went to church today and relaxed at home a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, just felt like sharing something in regard to what I've learned something interesting in my constitutional law class in which my professor pointed it out to us regarding that there seems to be no explanation of what the judicial branch's power really is, being expressed in Article III of the Constitution, and it made me think that there's got to be somewhere in the Article that explains what the supreme court really does, as well in terms of power. Anyhow, I'm not going to delve into it, so I'll leave it at that for some people reading this to think about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, there has been a video posted up on the youtube site which is hillarious and amusing, in which I first saw it at work about a month ago, and now the video has hit up to nearly three-million views, so go check it out entitled "&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrWu13Uh2Yw" target="_blank"&gt;Huntsville Rapist Bed Intruder Song&lt;/a&gt;".</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8676018816282342094'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8676018816282342094'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/09/another-semester-begins.html' title='Another semester begins!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-8071572518347953981</id><published>2010-08-15T19:22:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2010-08-15T21:00:24.641-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Operation Missions Week</title><content type='html'>So I know I haven't posted anything in quite a while on this blog, but had a really interesting previous week down in Wichita, Kansas where I was working with six other people, including Mat achen, on a MGOCSM missions trip held annually. Besides the heat and humidity throughout the whole week, I guess what I can say regarding the whole trip was that it was truly a remarkable experience to go through, in which we all helped build and paint homes for &lt;i&gt;Habitat for Humanity&lt;/i&gt;, spoke to some wonderful sisters at the convent where we stayed for the entire week, plus took a tour to see a future monastery in place and an Antiochan Orthodox church with such sacred icons of the Orthodox church. Generally overall, it was truly an amazing and blessed experience working to change the world by making "one Act of Random Kindness [ARK] at a time" (Quote from Morgan Freeman in &lt;i&gt;Evan Almighty&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving back home in New York yesterday afternoon, was extremely exhausted throughout the rest of the weekend, and had a family barbeque at our home last night.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8071572518347953981'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8071572518347953981'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/08/operation-missions-week.html' title='Operation Missions Week'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-5627364244501446386</id><published>2010-07-25T17:58:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2010-07-25T20:09:43.560-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week of Movies and Fun!</title><content type='html'>This past week was a pretty awesome and fun week considering that I ended my summer classes on Wednesday.

In addition to that, yesterday I got the time to hang out with my awesome fun-loving family at Swithin's house to meet his new mate, Rena, and her family. Generally speaking this week went absolutely well and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, I found out a movie trailer link that's coming out on October 1st regarding about how Facebook was created, entitled &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53OUHupfqws" target="_blank"&gt;The Social Network&lt;/a&gt;, in which I found out yesterday from my cousins, and some said this movie is probably going to be dull.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5627364244501446386'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5627364244501446386'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/07/week-of-movies-and-fun.html' title='Week of Movies and Fun!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7987110647495040462</id><published>2010-07-18T21:50:00.004-04:00</published><updated>2010-07-18T22:06:38.053-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Weekly Linked-List</title><content type='html'>So this past week was quite interesting with school, work, and of course browsing the web in order to improve my programming skills. I actually found three helpful links regarding HTML5 and CSS3. One of them is entitled &lt;a href="http://css3please.com" target="_blank"&gt;CSS3Please.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty much a playground site for css developers. Another one is an html5 article from the well-renowned Yahoo developer, Nicholas C. Zakas's website labeled &lt;a href="http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2008/02/28/thoughts-on-html-5/" target="_blank"&gt;Thoughts on HTML 5&lt;/a&gt;, and finally the third link is called &lt;a href="http://ajaxian.com" target="_blank"&gt;Ajaxian&lt;/a&gt; about various web development topics. I've been also falling in love with one of Apple's newest products, the iPad, in which it is great for web developers like myself, and considering that all techies have one. Other than that, I've had a pretty awesome and tiresome week so far, hopefully things will turn out better this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-YAQ1wfNqc&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;amp;color2=0x999999&amp;amp;hd=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/1-YAQ1wfNqc&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;fs=1?color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;amp;color2=0x999999&amp;amp;hd=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7987110647495040462'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7987110647495040462'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/07/weekly-linked-list.html' title='Weekly Linked-List'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-3806732087521995290</id><published>2010-07-11T22:05:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2010-07-11T22:15:28.663-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Another Summer Weekly Turnout</title><content type='html'>This past week was just another week of internship and school, so didn't do much except hearing on Fox News that Lebron James moving part to the Miami Heat now.

So today, didn't a get a chance to go to church, but my sister and Anita from Philly went though. A while later, her brother and wife, Anish-chach and Debbie-chechi, came along from Queens and spent some time at our house for the first time. I just relaxed, ate, and hung out with some cousins who came along, during the night from a youth barbeque. Overall, it was a pretty good week.

Today, went to church and celebrated Dinah's graduation. Then later, went to the usual Brush Hollow theatres to watch Toy Story 3 with the family. The movie was absolutely great.

I've been rather busy with my summer classes as well. It has been fairly humid throughout this month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this past weekend was fun actually, where I took the train solo, for the first time, into the city for a class trip to the Museum of Modern Art (also known as MoMA). Then, stopped by to visit my cousins, Ranjit and Bavan, and finally got back home at around eleven at night. Yesterday, went over to another cousins', Shanu and Sherry-chechi, house to hang out. But later, went over to Ranjit's house to go see the newlyweds, Ranjit and Erica. Overall, I had a pretty fun weekend! I am very much trilled about what this summer is going to bring for me and my family.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/1561393405699161781'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/1561393405699161781'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/06/weekend-recap.html' title='Weekend Recap!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-1433569357547828297</id><published>2010-04-25T23:06:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-25T23:11:19.090-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 16 Update!</title><content type='html'>So anyway this past week was very weary from the fantastic wedding weekend I've had with my family.

When we got to church things went well smoothly, and after that went off to dinner and got a chance to converse with both families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the following day which was the big wedding day for my cousin, went over to his house at like ten in the morning for getting ready, breakfast, some photo shoots, and prayer. Then, went inside the limo on the way to church and to the reception hall. But on the way to the reception, we made a pit stop for another photo shoot at a beautiful place, which happened to be private property, but then again managed to get through it. Both the wedding and reception were really wonderful and well-organized, especially the band that played all night. After the reception, which ended at like elevenish, went inside a bar until one (didn't know how I got in) and conversed with some really cool people of Ranjit and Erica. I later went back to my hotel room (shared with Justin and Alex) and slept at three or so, and woke up at about eight in the morning. That Sunday morning, went off to have brunch and started to check out of the hotel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the marvelous wedding, my sister and I went with the Colorado family on the way home. Then made a pit-stop on the bridge (don't remember which one though) to help out an accident that just occurred in front of us. So, went home, got some rest, and went off to Syosset for Jabin's birthday party, which also turned out great as well as some people, including myself, were really tired from the wedding weekend. So overall, I have had an amazing and fun-filled weekend to remember with family and friends. Also, I have met some of the old school Iota Nu Delta brothers there at the wedding as well, which was pretty much to me a big honor to meet them.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5320194184350719497'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5320194184350719497'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/04/wedding-weekend.html' title='The Wedding Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-3659350268011330980</id><published>2010-04-11T20:47:00.011-04:00</published><updated>2010-04-11T22:18:59.561-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 14 Report!</title><content type='html'>Anyway this past week was yet another week going through school and doing the usual at home. However, I was home alone all weekend while family went to New Jersey and Philadelphia for my sister's college open house tours, and of course visiting family there as well. So, spent the entire weekend watching movies on tbs, and catching up on the golf Masters' Tournament, in which Phil Mickelson won his third title this year, and Tiger and KJ Choi eventually came in a tie at fourth place. I also actually spent the night at Sherry and Shanu's house, and met with my cousins there who happened to visit from Bangalore, India for Ranjit's wedding that's eventually coming up this Saturday, can't wait for that though! Generally, I had a pretty decent week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as that, I came across a &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/SWitHBeAtZ/status/11674793769" target="_blank"&gt;recent tweet&lt;/a&gt; on my cousin's twitter page this past week that brought to my mind a lot about Apple's new product, the iPad, and I totally agree with him on this one.

The beginning was mentioned before in the last post as I've went to church for the Passion week services. Over the weekend on Saturday night, went to the movies at Broadway Mall and saw "How to train a Dragon" in 3D with the cuzinz, and really enjoyed a lot. Then yesterday, which was Easter Sunday, got to church extra early at like 5:45 in the morning. After church, relaxed at home a bit, then went off to Syosset for the family easter party, which was pretty fun as well. Anyway, I've had a pretty awesome week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I've also seen the trailer to this movie that I'm really looking forward to watching called "Despicable Me" with Steve Carell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/DsiayV5LuD0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/DsiayV5LuD0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5930073334128169828'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5930073334128169828'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/04/spring-break-10.html' title='Spring Break &apos;10'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-5310942084207456151</id><published>2010-03-30T12:04:00.005-04:00</published><updated>2010-03-30T15:15:17.970-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 12 Update &amp; Cool Links</title><content type='html'>This past week and weekend update was pretty much posted up on my Ponnasseril family website, where I got the chance to see the city a lot more with my fellow 'cuzinz'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this week I'm actually observing Holy &amp; Passion Week, coming to an end to this Great Lent.

Actually been kind of surprised at Cornell and Tennessee going further into the &lt;em&gt;Sweet 16&lt;/em&gt; round of the tournament. I also happened to love someone's facebook status saying "it be a great Office episode, if cornell won! GO NARDDOG!", or otherwise known as Andy Bernard (fictional character from Cornell played by Ed Helms). Overall, had a pretty decent week. On an additional note, I also watched the movie &lt;em&gt;300&lt;/em&gt; just recently tonight on tbs, which I think happened to give a deep philosophy on Greek culture.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7684895146816400775'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7684895146816400775'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/03/week-11.html' title='Week 11'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-1032838770639755937</id><published>2010-03-14T19:14:00.009-04:00</published><updated>2010-03-15T22:19:26.991-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Madness has begun!</title><content type='html'>This past week was going smoothly for me considering classes went well, midterms are steadily approaching, and lent is also coming to an end with Holy Passion Week coming up.

Anyway, I've actually been getting used to my new school, hanging out with friends, browsing through some random videos and reading some new blog and twitter-feeds, plus learning some new programming languages on the side via youtube. On another note, getting into lenten season mode nowadays while reading all the Scripture readings, online devotionals, and special prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend, went to Philly with family and aunt from India to go visit some family there. For my first time in Philly, went to go see a movie with the cousins at the United Artist Theatres near their apartment, "Alice in Wonderland" starring Johnny Depp, which was an ok movie to watch. After the movie, went to Dunkin' Donuts, and spent the night. Then on Sunday, went to St. Gregorios, Philadelphia church to receive the Holy Qurbana for the fourth week in a row during GL (aka Great Lent). After that, went back to the apartments and spent some time there with the cousins until one cousin, Nathan, came around and things got really fun.

Plus, watched today's NFL-AFC championship game with my all-time favorite team, the NY Jets, and Indianapolis Colts, it was kind of awkward for me regarding that I had both teams as part of my defense on my fantasy team last season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyway, like I've said in my previous blogposts, I've been very much fond of twitter and its history.

This past week was absolutely amazing for me considering that I got accepted as a transfer computer science student at the SUNY College at Old Westbury, still figuring out the details this week though. Also, got paid from my part-time job as a web-designer. On Friday, saw Avatar in 3d at the Levittown theaters, with my sister, and the movie was absolutely amazing as the critics said it was, especially with awesome effects and graphics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, today went to church, especially today was my ammachi's three year memorial anniversary (miss you always). After church, went to McDonald's to grab breakfast with the family, and then went straight home and got ready for our usual family prayer meeting, which was held at our house. So anyway, before the prayer started, watched the Jets/Chargers game with the cousins, amazing JETS won that game and go further into the playoffs next week. After the prayer, watched my favorite character on Parks and Recreation, Aziz Ansari's (aka Tom Havorford in the show) comedy show, along with Russell Peters. So anyway overall, had a fantastic and sweeet week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah also, I've been very fond of twitter nowadays, especially the fact about their site's history, design, and people's tweets, I think I might get one this week, not sure though!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2532663795260050564'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2532663795260050564'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2010/01/second-week-progress.html' title='Second Week Progress!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-9108344630125539131</id><published>2010-01-10T18:06:00.011-05:00</published><updated>2010-01-10T21:04:02.016-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>First Week!</title><content type='html'>This past week was the first week of the new year, 2010. After the whole Christmas/New Year's celebrations at different houses, things felt kind of bored nowadays. On the other hand, I actually got a part-time job working at a small pool company in Westbury as a web designer, with a decent wage, in which I found it on craigslist. Anyway, the job started out good and still progressing. Yesterday and today, didn't do much either except watch movies on tv, went to church, and watching a little bit of football, especially when the Jets won last night. So, overall, the year went off to a good start for week one. Hopefully, more exciting and fun stuff will be arriving in the coming months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know I haven't been actively sending out videos through this blog, but this past week, I actually was browsing around and found a lot of information regarding Twitter and its creator, Jack Dorsey.

I actually placed first in the end of the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then on Sunday, went to church, and after church, went to the airport to pick up one of my aunts who flew in from Nashville. Also, got the chance to go over to my friend, Tom's house, in which I actually played, as a first-timer, water pong (the virgin-version of beer pong). After that, went to TGIFriday's restaurant with my family and aunt, and then went home.

I actually got the chance to watch "Paul Blart: Mall Cop", which was another awesome movie for me. On Sunday, felt kinda sick and stayed in bed all day and night.

After my final on Friday, got a chance to go to Catiague Park in Hicksville, to watch the official IND probate of the NYIT Gamma class, which was pretty insane to watch, and also it was cold outside. After the probate, went to Broadway mall and hung out and chill with some of the brothers, at the food court, which was pretty sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, it started snowing pretty heavily and badly. While it snowed, just watched some holiday movies on tv. Today, didn't go to church because of the storm that occurred last night. So, relaxed a bit, watched some movies, and studying for my lit final for tomorrow. Anyway, I have to get ready for the Christmas season, this Friday, to spend a decent time with my loving family.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7122862286188183272'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7122862286188183272'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/12/week-15-update.html' title='Week 15 Update!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7339143382123807904</id><published>2009-12-13T13:58:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2009-12-13T19:23:16.793-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 14!</title><content type='html'>This past week was pretty good for me, considering that on Friday was my 20th birthday.

On Wednesday, went over to my former high school to pick up my diploma, nothing much has changed after I graduated. Then went off to Justin and Alex's house to help me with some homework before going on vacation on Thursday. On Thursday, actually packed up and went off to Philly for Thanksgiving dinner at Nathan's house. At the party, ate some delicious food there and then eventually played taboo because some people got bored. After that, slept over at Anita's house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, woke up early to go on a family reunion trip to Virginia. The adults were in the big van, while the kids were in the jeep. On the way there, stopped by the DC area to visit, yeah that's right!, the White House. Also, stopped by with lunch at this restaurant called Cracker Barrel. Then, it got dark, and all of our phones were out of range, when we finally reached there at the Eagle Landing cabins. Throughout the weekends, actually took the time to get to have fellowship and fun with everyone. We all did activities like playing games (e.g. Scattergories), canoeing, hiking, and zip-lining (although I didn't go). On Saturday night, our family had this talent show for some people perform, which was pretty hillarious especially the ones introducing the Molethu Family Enterprises. Then, on Sunday, packed up and was ready to hit the roads. Actually showed up at Philly around six and went home back to New York and reached at like eleven. I felt pretty tired from the long drives in and out of Virginia, but a blessed time with my huge Molethu family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah also I think I actually won this week for my fantasy football league, even though I didn't pay attention.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/571790092467557192'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/571790092467557192'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/11/week-12-and-fun-packed-weekend.html' title='Week 12 and a Fun-Packed Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-8133815647369880416</id><published>2009-11-23T15:45:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-23T16:09:59.504-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 11 Recap!</title><content type='html'>What can I say about Week 11 is that I went to the Intervarsity Christian fellowship Thanksgiving dinner this past Wednesday night at NYIT. It was pretty good with the praise skits, songs, and an awesome freestyle Christian rapper. So anyway, on Friday night, went to one of my church friend's house to chill, hangout, and go grab some food from Taco Bell for dinner, because of my sister's movie plans were cancelled due to some situations going on at the Roosevelt Field mall, where Justin Bieber (did not know him until that day) was supposed to perform. But eventually she got her tickets back and saw it on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, just spent some time at my cousins', Justin and Alex's, house watching tv and movies and an episode of The Office. Yesterday, went to church, then went to a church member's housewarming, later went to my other cousins', Shanu and Sherry's, house to do some work. A while later that night, went to my cousin's, Bavan's, house for the monthly family prayer meeting. Overall, I had a pretty awesome week and cannot wait for Thanksgiving and the family getaway reunion this week...should be really fun!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8133815647369880416'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/8133815647369880416'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/11/week-11-recap.html' title='Week 11 Recap!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7985461609659166863</id><published>2009-11-16T17:26:00.010-05:00</published><updated>2009-11-23T16:07:23.489-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 10 Update!</title><content type='html'>This past week was a decent week as well, didn't do much except classes and attend campus men's ministry.

On Friday night, was once again home alone (along with Dinah), while parents went to Jersey (and came back that night as well). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, actually spent the whole day doing nothing, and for the rest of the evening went over to Swithin's house for the regular family prayer meeting, barbeque, and as a special treat, celebrated the 60th birthdays for his dad and Shanu and Sherry's dad. After that, watched again The Office, because of Shanu didn't get to see it on Thursday. I was actually impressed by Jay Sean and Russell Peters at their videos on youtube, very nice and hillarious. Today, went to church, and after church, went home to watch some football (Jets/Patriots and Steelers/Bears games). Amazing turnout by both the Jets and the Bears.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5708676504570694543'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5708676504570694543'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/09/week-2-update.html' title='Week 2 Update'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-7564750706258695676</id><published>2009-09-13T22:43:00.005-04:00</published><updated>2009-09-13T22:54:23.758-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Week 1 Update</title><content type='html'>This past week, I started classes at NYIT, last Tuesday, and classes are good so far.

Also, I met some really cool roommates and friends.

We did a couple of icebreaker activities and listened to a couple of devotionals and messages by the main speakers. That evening, had a barbeque, met some really cool and nice people there, and bouncing the volleyball high in the air. On Friday, did the usual on the listed routine, got the official camp t-shirts, and had a retreat-mode evening to night in preparation for Holy Qurbana. On Saturday, celebrated the Holy Qurbana at 9:00 AM, and cleaned everything up after people checked out. After the camp, made a pit-stop at Anita's house and then went straight to Jobin's apartment, talked, watched a movie for a bit, and slept early because I was tired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, went to service at St. Gregorios, Philadelphia and was a newcomer there as well. It was my first time seeing the church after the consecration, in which the church looked beautiful. Anyway, went back to the apartment, watched another movie (&lt;em&gt;Alvin and the Chipmunks&lt;/em&gt;), and headed back to New York with the family.

Overall, this was another fantastic and amazing weekend.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2664667997330416846'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2664667997330416846'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/06/another-fantastic-weekend.html' title='Another Fantastic Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-399198419520935837</id><published>2009-05-17T23:41:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2009-05-17T23:47:47.210-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Weekend Turnout!</title><content type='html'>This past weekend went to church to drop off my sister and friend at church for choir practice, then off to my cousin's house to drop off a calculator, in which I stayed a bit later to chill and eat.

Overall, this past weekend was just another ordinary fun-packed weekend!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6486918484098466511'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6486918484098466511'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/02/what-weekend.html' title='What a Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-441606118211772897</id><published>2009-01-30T23:41:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2009-02-16T12:17:13.156-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Stop Blaming Bush!</title><content type='html'>Here's an interesting political cartoon I found on Digg.com entitled, "&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.timeinc.net/time/cartoons/20090123/cartoons_04.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Well At Least I Got One Thing Done!!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;", about former president George W.

At first, we went to my second cousin's child's birthday party and chit-chatted a bit with some of my cousins. Then, went off to go see other family members who lived in the area because my aunt (from India) wanted to visit them. That night, I stayed at my cousin, Anita's house, while my dad and aunt stayed with family in Jersey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, woke up (nice of waking up normally rather by waking up early for my church), and got ready to go to my cousin's church, St. Gregorios, Philadelphia. The church looked beautiful, except for the altars since it was still under construction. Also, I got to have the chance to participate and take Holy Qurbana from the new church. After service, while I ate lunch at church, I got to meet some family and friends. After church, went off to Anita's house for me to pack my stuff and then we three, me, dad, and aunty, rode off home to New York. Overall, I've had an amazing experience traveling here and there, and seeing some family and friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, here is an interesting comic strip I found on digg, earlier, and it's very true considering I'm a computer science major and felt the same way, as the guy who always have questions, when I learned about computer architecture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SWGTnK43RsI/AAAAAAAAANI/pxDQdQWQxLo/s1600-h/cp101.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 244px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SWGTnK43RsI/AAAAAAAAANI/pxDQdQWQxLo/s320/cp101.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287669738656712386" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5139147376239492223'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/5139147376239492223'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2009/01/amazing-weekend.html' title='Amazing Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SWGTnK43RsI/AAAAAAAAANI/pxDQdQWQxLo/s72-c/cp101.jpg' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-528762911094260716</id><published>2009-01-01T21:09:00.007-05:00</published><updated>2009-01-08T17:07:28.684-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>New Year's Resolutions!</title><content type='html'>Oh my, 2008 and 2007 went by so fast.

He discussed about some of his experiences, Mathew 6 &amp; 7, and Deuteronomy 8. After that, we had some snacks like cupcakes, cakes, chips, etc. and I met and talked to some friends from LIMC and St. John's MTC. Then, some cousins and I went to a local diner to eat for dinner and talked for a while, and I spent the night over at my cousin's house. On Sunday, I got up early exactly at 5AM (not usually an early bird), got ready for church, and my family picked me up from there to church.

One of the verses in which he referred to was St. Luke 12:48 and the temptations we go through everyday that distracts us from our way towards our goals. Greg semessan also mentioned the core values in our life, which are: family, work, and spiritual life. As well as, he discussed about the meaning of one of the qurbana's hymns, "&lt;em&gt;Blessed are those servants good...&lt;/em&gt;", and how it all relates to our relationship with God. After that, we went into two small groups and discussed about different issues with school and church.

The theme was &lt;em&gt;Uncovering Our Roots: Bringing Orthodoxy Back&lt;/em&gt;. At first, it started off with me saying goodbye to my folks and headed off to LaGuardia Airport; Central Terminal at Baggage Claim. There, I was greeted by the NYLC Transportation Committee, and some new people still waiting for the bus. While still waiting, they played a few icebreaker games to keep us entertained. Anyway, I went on the van, to Ramapo, and on the way I met three people from Houston, one from Detroit, and the rest from my area. So, total in the van were eight (including myself), along with the driver, which happened to be Saju Chacko (aka MC Vikram). When we arrived there at Ramapo, I started to register at the NYLC front table and getting settled in my dorm room. After that, we started going off to dinner and evening prayers, and then there was the lighting of the lamp along with a few messages by Barnabas and Nicholovos Thiruminis, Mat semessan (General Secretary), and the co-conveners, Jomy Chandy and Anu Jacob. After all that, they showed some presentations (including the new AM-Team video), which is also shown on &lt;a href="http://www.nylc08.com" target="_blank"&gt;www.nylc08.com&lt;/a&gt;. We then were separated into our small groups, I was part of the A-Train. The first thing we had to do was an icebreaker, in which we had to do a small skit, without talking, and people had to guess what it was (my group was about the Paralytic). After the icebreaker, we had some refreshments and then went off to our area meetings to discuss about leadership. After the meeting, we had game night in the dorm lobby, in which everyone was playing either cards, pictionary, or even taboo. At the end of the night, we concluded by saying the compline prayers and heading off to bed. My roommates and I started staying up so late and talking about simple stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, I kind of woke up late, than the usual schedule. In the morning, we had a special wake-up call by the committee, banging drums and our doors to wake us up for prayers, devotional address by Gheevarghese chem, devotional songs, and our first main speaker, Fr. Josiah, who was funny in most of his speeches. Then, there were workshops discussing about the Church, noon prayer, lunch, and a small group activity, which was a scavenger hunt (my group came in second to last). Then, we had another main speaker, Mother Magdalena, refreshments, another small group discussion, panel discussion, and then dinner. After all that, we had evening prayer and devotional address by Daniel chem. Then, we got ready for a team building activity in the gym, including Blob tag. We all then went outside for a special ice cream treat, playing basketball and volleyball, talking, and music playing. This event was so memorable. It ended with compline prayers and we just sitting and talking to each other, including Daniel chem making fun of Tenny Thomas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, it started off with the usual, this time I woke up nice and early. Some of us were tired during the lectures and workshops, but I tried keeping myself awake. All the small groups did something really cool, which was writing our own kukliyons. My group, however, did it small because we didn't have enough time to finish it. Anyway, we then had lunch, songs, and a presentation by the missions trip team of 2008. We then went off to our area meetings to discuss about witnessing and the mission within our areas. After that, we had an MGOCSM General Assembly meeting discussing about the annual secretary and financial reports, along with electing a new Genral Secretary and Treasurer. After that, the 2009 Atlanta Leadership Camp committee shown us a promo presentation (also shown on YouTube). After that presentation, all the small groups presented our own kukliyons (my group had Jimmy Panicker from Chicago doing the censor), then the conveners presented the souvenirs, and then went off to dinner. After dinner, we had evening prayer, a retreat message, and meditational times before Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sunday, we woke up at 5:30 AM, and then got ready for morning prayers and Holy Qurbana. After the service, we had our entire Leadership Camp group photo being taken, along with closing remarks by the conveners, a slide show, a reflection session by each area representative, and the lighting of the lamp for the 2009 leadership camp in Atlanta. After all that, we had lunch, packed our things, checked out, and said our goodbyes to each other. Overall, it was truly an amazing and blessed experience of my life, and I still miss everyone I met there.

Anyway, when we got there, we first grabbed lunch, and I ate a chicken tenders meal, with fries and a Mountain Dew. After that, we went on our hiking trail and it was absolutely beautiful seeing nature and the falls flowing. It kind of made me reminisce about the time when I went on that trip to St. Tikhon's Seminary. So, anyway, most of us were a little tired about going up and down the stairs, of the mountain. After the hike, we then relaxed a bit, and then rode off home, back to New York. Also, we stopped at an outlet store on the way, Odd-A-Lot, in which one of my cousins bought fireworks to use for himself. So, we decided to grab some dinner at this Thai restaurant called &lt;em&gt;Jaiya&lt;/em&gt;. Overall, it was a fun adventure and a great experience for me.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7128126636568166693'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/7128126636568166693'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/07/adventure-packed-weekend.html' title='Adventure-Packed Weekend!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-8041835660623768059</id><published>2008-07-11T21:44:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2008-07-11T21:55:49.229-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Finally!!!</title><content type='html'>Today, I finally finished reading the book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Long Way Gone; Memoirs of a Boy Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, by Ishmael Beah, which took me five days.

Anyway, on Saturday, went to one of my parishioner's house for another barbeque, and then went off to Brush Hollow theatres to go see the movie, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALL-E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, with all the cousins. &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALL-E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was boring in the beginning, but as the movie went on, it got interesting, hillarious, and romantic. After the movie, my cousins and I went to &lt;em&gt;Friendly's&lt;/em&gt; to eat dinner. So anyway, today, went to church and after the service, there was a special graduation ceremony for all the class of 2008 graduates. I finally got an official Orthodox Study Bible (both Old and New Testament), given to all the high school seniors, blessed by the vicar and parish. Finally, went to a friend's house, talked and hung out, and ate pizza.

We had our very own Rev.Dn.Daniel Mathai (aka Dennis) as our speaker. Today's bible study topic was about "&lt;em&gt;Discipleship&lt;/em&gt;", talking about the lives of the Holy Apostles of Christ (including St. Paul), and the previous 13-day lent, which ended today. One of the key aspects of being a Disciple is &lt;em&gt;Faith&lt;/em&gt;. Dn. Daniel pointed out two portions of the Bible which are Revelations 3:14-22 (explaining Lukewarm Christians) and the other, 1 Peter 3:8-22. Anyway, I had fun being there and it was a great experience learning more about the disciples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 235px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SiL4IszPJSI/AAAAAAAAATU/z0U83ahr54Q/s320/disciples.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342104936363533602"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2060839709080634172'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2060839709080634172'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/06/bible-study-discipleship.html' title='Bible Study: Discipleship!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SiL4IszPJSI/AAAAAAAAATU/z0U83ahr54Q/s72-c/disciples.jpg' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-1134452220054702412</id><published>2008-06-25T15:47:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-25T15:52:50.321-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Finally!</title><content type='html'>I finally read the Book of Revelation, for two days, from chapters 1-22!

First, I went to church and received Holy Qurbana. After that, went home for a while to rest and such. Then, we, my family (including two cousins of mine), went to Hofstra University's Arena where the graduation ceremony took place. It was pretty decent with all the inspirational messages said by several administrators and of course, the valedictorian and salutatorian. The valedictorian referred his speech to the video game, &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, which was pretty hillarious. Anyway, after graduation, went to TGIFriday's restaurant to eat lunch with the family. Overall, it was amazing and I'm sure I;m going to miss those days back in high school, and look forward towards the next chapter of my life, college. Here are some pictures to look at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SF8MD-Aw8LI/AAAAAAAAAHA/un5KPmRyYHQ/s320/IMG_0090.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900155843670194"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SF8MUxO7PdI/AAAAAAAAAHI/xwTFOpj9oMw/s320/IMG_0094.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900444471180754"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SF8Mi1jwu6I/AAAAAAAAAHY/iwBwHzWDoZw/s320/IMG_0101.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900686150482850"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SF8MbzI6IiI/AAAAAAAAAHQ/2UDpvDyt4v8/s320/IMG_0097.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5214900565241897506"&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6618859438718121864'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/6618859438718121864'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/06/graduation-day.html' title='Graduation Day!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_81J2RsAe6x4/SF8MD-Aw8LI/AAAAAAAAAHA/un5KPmRyYHQ/s72-c/IMG_0090.JPG' height='72' width='72'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-1741637343769717204</id><published>2008-06-13T22:16:00.006-04:00</published><updated>2008-06-15T00:06:44.789-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Last Day of High School!</title><content type='html'>Here are some pictures that I took today, the last day of high school.

On the first Saturday, of the break (April 19), I went to my cousin's house in Syosset to celebrate my little nephew's, Jabin, second birthday, and on the following Sunday, I went to my cousin, Swithin's house to celebrate his birthday. That weekend was a blast from hanging out with the cousins and watching &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; funny clips. During the week, I visited NYIT and finalized everything and also, I started to begin my own website business project, which is still under development. On the following Saturday, April 26th, I went to church for the Perunal celebration of my home parish, after 23 years! Also, my parish has finally put up a curtain on the Altar, and I thought it was real nice and huge. Today, I went to my other cousin's, Rancha and Bavancha, house for the family prayer meeting. I just spoke about what I said on my previous blogpost, about drinking the wine regularly or not.

St. Paul writes in 1 Timothy 5:23 that, "&lt;em&gt;No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.&lt;/em&gt;" Also, in the parable of the Good Samaritan, it says that he put wine on the beaten Jew's wounds, and then put olive oil.

Hope you all like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One of my career goals is to be in the information systems field. In the eighth grade, I became interested in this field and since then, I started looking at the e-mail exchanges and internet tools that my cousins were using for planning family events. So, I thought maybe we could start our own family discussion board or a family website. At first, I told one of my cousins about the project, but soon, it had quickly spread throughout the whole family. I started the project in 2005 and have maintained it ever since. Generally, this led to the desire in wanting to assist people in communicating through the technology that exists today and developing new ones for the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Another career goal I would like to achieve would include being part of a top management firm that handles information systems or setting up an online sole proprietorship. Initially, I took many business classes at my local high school and received excellent grades. In these classes, I learned a variety of topics like web design, computer programming, software applications, and media production. A few of these classes were slightly difficult at first, however with hard work they became easy. Taking these business classes helped me build analytical and leadership skills. Therefore, pursuing majors like finance, business, or marketing will not only help me in developing my knowledge of the financial world and business models, but the classes within these majors will equip me with the proper communication, marketing, and strategic skills required to become a leader in the industry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/4217328228582410638'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/4217328228582410638'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/04/career-goals.html' title='Career Goals'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-2919419918298469523</id><published>2008-03-23T15:29:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2008-03-23T15:45:15.187-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Happy Easter!!!</title><content type='html'>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.lukedingman.com/imagesicon/2resurrection.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHRIST IS RISEN, INDEED HE IS RISEN, GLORIFY HIM!!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read it in the Gospel according to St. Matthew 28:1-10.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2919419918298469523'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/2919419918298469523'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/03/happy-easter.html' title='Happy Easter!!!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-1251225163433930509</id><published>2008-03-21T21:19:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2008-03-21T21:24:49.910-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Good Friday Service</title><content type='html'>&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.lukedingman.com/imagesicon/crucifixion.jpg" width="300"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;em&gt;We bow before the Cross by which we received salvation for our souls and with the thief we cry out; "Remember us, O Christ, when You Come."&lt;/em&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/1251225163433930509'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/1251225163433930509'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2008/03/good-friday-service.html' title='Good Friday Service'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-3789982370006562468</id><published>2008-03-09T18:47:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2008-03-10T23:04:14.312-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Blessed Weekend!!</title><content type='html'>I had fun this past weekend.

I usually update these sites once a month.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/116994833000885281'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/116994833000885281'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-design-my-family-websites-for.html' title='About me'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-116957205568738102</id><published>2007-01-23T12:05:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-09T19:02:46.549-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Homeboys Video!</title><content type='html'>&lt;center&gt;&lt;object width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v-fu7g5oo28&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;border=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v-fu7g5oo28&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999&amp;border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" width="400" height="300"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a video that was created by the Homeboys of St. Stephen's Orthodox Church of Long Island, NY</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/116957205568738102'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/38713770/posts/default/116957205568738102'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://theuiguru.blogspot.com/2007/01/this-is-video-that-was-created-by.html' title='Homeboys Video!'/><author><name>Chris</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00985125530421982935</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-pJPmyL9-7uc/TsiN5mvYyCI/AAAAAAAABXE/ssVu4bdcnmA/s32/chris.jpg'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-38713770.post-116957164174293106</id><published>2007-01-23T11:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2016-08-01T10:10:25.393-04:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>CUZINZ in Denver!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;This is a picture of my cousins at my cousin, Rekha's engagement in Denver, Colorado.
