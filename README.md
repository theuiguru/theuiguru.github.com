#### Think Bright, Think CT!
1. "Every protagonist of every story, show, or movie is the story of my life."
2. "It only takes 1-RTT to attain happiness in life."
<code>if c is happy:
        if p && m are happy:
                print c("HAPPY! HAPPY! HAPPY!")</code>
3. [OBEY] + [WORK HARD] + [PRAY] = "Live long and prosper."
4. "Life is definitely not easy, but then again it's not hard if you try."
5. "If Someone's happiness is your happiness, then you really love them."
6. "Be the person you want to find. Don't be a nickel out here looking for a dime."
7. ASAP! Always Say A Prayer: "God, our Father, If it is your will, walk through my house and take 
away all my worries and illnesses and please watch over and heal my 
family in Jesus name, Amen."
